# 🍽️ Food Stall Tracker (MERN Stack Project)

## 📖 Project Overview

Food Stall Tracker is a full-stack MERN application developed to manage and track food stalls.  
This project allows users to add, view, update, and delete food stall information easily.

The main objective of this project is to understand and implement MERN stack concepts such as:
- REST APIs
- MongoDB database integration
- React frontend development
- Backend deployment
- API integration using Axios

This project was developed as part of the MERN lab evaluation.
